## Hands

<!-- Maybe this section should be rewritten by an unbiased party? -->

The hands do unfortunately have some minor visible imperfections, and the presence of hair (altough clear and thin) really ruins their look as seen in real life; in photos the situation is often much better. Form is overall well-balanced, even if there are some points of slight deformation.
